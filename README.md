🚑 Hospital EMR Data Pipeline for Business Intelligence
This project showcases a complete data engineering pipeline for ingesting, storing, and visualizing Electronic Medical Records (EMR) data from a hospital setting. Built using Azure Data Factory (ADF), Azure SQL Database, and Power BI, the goal is to make EMR data accessible and insightful for stakeholders through effective Business Intelligence (BI).

📊 Project Overview
Source: Hospital EMR Data (structured files)

Pipeline Tool: Azure Data Factory (ADF)

Data Storage: Azure SQL Database

BI Visualization: Power BI Dashboards

The pipeline handles data ingestion, transformation, and storage for downstream BI reporting and analytics.
